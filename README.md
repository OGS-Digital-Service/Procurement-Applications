# Procurement-Applications
Style Repo for PAWS, COMET, and Filed Requirements

Each project in this repo will have its own folder with assets organized into them and local html template files for browser preview. A common component assets folder will be at the highest level as well.

# COMMON Folder
In here you'll find the base template files with assets for the NYS Global and Universal Navigations as well as component level styles for resuable applications components (built/styled using bootstrap 3).

<strong> Isolated Components folder </strong> contains template-agnostic styling for some basic components, such as paragraph items, buttons, form and inputs, headings, and others.


# PAWS
Nectai - I'll mark updates specifically for you and let you know by email as well.

# COMET
Files in the COMMON folder may help get set up and project specific items can be committed to the master folders in this directory.

# Filed Reqs
Files in the COMMON folder may help get set up and project specific items can be committed to the master folders in this directory.
